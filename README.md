# giphy-API

In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with  horror gifs. I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

* giphy-API app is fully mobile responsive.

* Users allow to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.

* When the user clicks one of theGIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

* Top of every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

* User can remove their last action.

You can visit the web site from [this link.](https://sialbul.github.io/giphy-API/)
